# LinApple

LinApple is an emulator for Apple ][, Apple ][+, Apple //e, and Enhanced Apple //e computers.

## History

LinApple started as a fork of [AppleWin](https://github.com/AppleWin/AppleWin), ported to run on Linux. The source code
was downloaded from [SourceForge](http://linapple.sourceforge.net/) and uploaded to Github by
[maxolasersquad](https://github.com/maxolasersquad). As the SourceForge version lay abandoned several users forked the
maxolasersquad repository and added several features. Work was done to bring these back into maxolasersquad repository.
This repository was eventually moved under the [linappleii](https://github.com/linappleii) namespace where development
currently resides.

## Command Line Switches

* `-d1 path/to/image1.dsk`: Specifies a disk image to load into FDD1 (drive 0)
* `-d2 path/to/image2.dsk`: Specifies a disk image to load into FDD1 (drive 1)
* `-f`: Specifies that the emulator should run in fullscreen mode
* `-b`: Specifies that benchmark should be loaded (untested)
* `-l`: Logs output to a file called AppleWin.log (untested)
* `-m`: Disables direct sound (untested)
* `-autoboot`: Boots the system automatically, rather than displaying the splash screen

**Warning**: Fullscreen mode does not properly exit in multi-monitor setups.  (This is a bug in SDL 1.2.)

When you first start the emulator, press the F3 key and select a disk image file. Press Ctrl+F2 to restart the emulator
with the disk "inserted" if the application doesn't automatically load.

Many disk images will boot straight into the application. Some disk images only have files and you must find the correct
application to run. In this case you will need to execute BASIC commands to list the files on the disk and run programs.

### Commands

#### CATALOG

This command lists the files on a disk.

The first column in the list identifies the file type. A for Applesoft BASIC. B for binary. I for Integer BASIC. T for
ASCII text.

The third column lists the name of the file.

#### RUN file

Execute the Applesoft BASIC or Integer BASIC file.

#### BRUN file

Execute the binary file.

#### EXEC file

Execute a text file as though it was typed from the keyboard.

#### LOAD file

Load a file, usually a text file, into memory.

#### LIST

List the current program in memory.

### Command-line options

Support for command-line options was originally added to linapple to allow users to set up
custom shell scripts to automatically load certain Apple ][ programs with the click of a
button, but it is evolving towards conventional command-line usage.

For example, to have linapple start in fullscreen and automatically boot the disk
`example.dsk`, you can open a shell and run

```bash
linapple -d1 example.dsk -f -autoboot
```

This command could also be placed in a shell script, which could be started from an
icon or menu on the desktop, etc.

Note that extensive testing has not been performed on all command-line options.

#### TODO

* Add a command line switch which allows the user to specify different configuration files.
